!!NOTE!! 
The armours increase your defense which reduces incoming damage

## Battle
Take turns against a unknown mob to try defeat them for coins.
You can buy moves from the shop that will make your attack more powerful
Having a greater sword will increase damage 
The mobs will be a higher level when you fight them - to give you a challenge.
